**1. Fast and accurate diagnostics**<br/>
Faster diagnosis can save the patient from more serious consequences and
   allows the patient to be well oriented, having a greater probability of showing
   a faster improvement. Knowing the diagnosis is better to look for possible treatments.

**2. Reduce errors related to human fatigue** <br/>

It is often a root cause of major accidents. AI can saves errors and can accomplish the duty
faster and more accurately.

**3. Virtual presence** <br/>

remote presence robot, doctors can check the patients without actually being there.
It is really helpful for the doctors who can monitor more patients at day and guarantee
more assistance for people.

The use of AI to harm certain people or things. Because the AI can be really explorated
